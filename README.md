The goal of this is to create an interface where the users can input the following:
The type of problem (ie. Linear Regression, Logistic Regression)
Model type, if they already have one in mind and it is available, (ie. LinearRegressionClassifier, RandomForestClassifier) or 'all' if they want this to choose the 'best' (this will take significantly more time)
Preferred metric (ie. Accuracy, F1 Score, ROC) or 'all' if the user prefer to see the best ib each category (unsure)
Ready to go data. This is meant for after the dataset is prepared for the problem at hand.
